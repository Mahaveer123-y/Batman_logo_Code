Batman Logo Code

Python code snippet that generates and plots the famous "Batman" symbol using mathematical functions. This is a fun and creative way to showcase how mathematical functions can be used to create interesting shapes. Here's a brief overview of the code:

Mathematical Functions:

The code uses several mathematical functions to define the coordinates (X, Y) of points that together form the shape of the Batman symbol.
Different ranges of Y values are used to define different parts of the Batman symbol.
Plotting:

The plt.plot function is used to plot the Batman symbol. The symbol is created by connecting points defined by the mathematical functions.
The symbol is plotted in yellow ('yo'), and the background style is set to dark using plt.style.use("dark_background").
Title:

The plot has a title "Batman" with a specific font size and weight.
Visualization:

The plt.show() function is used to visualize the plot.
This code provides a visual representation of the Batman symbol using mathematical functions. It's a creative example that demonstrates how mathematical expressions can be utilized for graphical representation.
